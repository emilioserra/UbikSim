          If you want to control better the light sources in your home, possibly

          their power indicator or by <a href="editingFurniture.html">editing</a> 
          their attributes. The power of the sun, the color and the direction 
          of its rays depend on the hour of the day and the selected date, but 
          also on the North direction, the geographic location and the time zone, 
          the latter parameters being managed by the <a href="editingCompass.html">compass</a>
