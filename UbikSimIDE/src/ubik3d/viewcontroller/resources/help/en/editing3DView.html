		<p>When <i>Aerial view</i> is selected, the 3D view displays your home 
          in 3 dimensions seen from a top point of view. In this mode, moving 
          the mouse to the left or to the right with its left button pressed makes 
          the home turn around a vertical axis located at home center&nbsp;; moving 
          the mouse forward or backward with its left button pressed makes the 
          home turn around an horizontal axis&nbsp;; rolling the mouse wheel zooms 
          in or out in the 3D view. <br>
          When <i>Virtual visit </i> is selected, the 3D view displays your home 
          in 3 dimensions seen from the point of view of a virtual visitor. In 
          this mode, moving the mouse to the left or to the right with its left 
          button pressed makes the visitor body turn to the left or to the right&nbsp;; 
          moving the mouse forward or backward with its left button pressed makes 
          the visitor head turn up or down&nbsp;; rolling the mouse wheel makes 
          the visitor move backward or forward. <br>
          In both modes, the <i>left arrow</i> and <i>right arrow</i> keys have 
          the same effect as mouse lateral moves ; <i>page up</i> and <i>page 
          down</i> keys have the same effect as mouse moves forward and backward&nbsp;; 
          <i>up arrow</i> and <i>down arrow</i> keys have the same effect as mouse 
          wheel. In <i>Virtual visit </i>mode, you can also use the <i>home</i> 
          and <i>end</i> keys to move up or down the visitor's point of view.</p>

                have the same effect as the matching keys of the keyboard, whereas

          is updated simultaneously in the plan and 3D view with each move of 
          the visitor. This virtual visitor is surrounded by four indicators.</p>
