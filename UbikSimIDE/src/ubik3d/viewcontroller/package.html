<body>
Describes controller classes and view interfaces of Sweet Home 3D. This package controls the edition 
of the data stored by the {@linkplain ubik3d.model model} classes of Sweet Home 3D.
<p>The {@link ubik3d.viewcontroller.HomeController HomeController} class is the 
main {@linkplain ubik3d.viewcontroller.Controller controller} 
of a home edited in Sweet Home 3D. This controller manages all the 
{@linkplain ubik3d.viewcontroller.HomeView.ActionType actions} proposed to the end user, 
creates various subcontrollers that manage 
{@linkplain ubik3d.viewcontroller.FurnitureCatalogController furniture catalog},
{@linkplain ubik3d.viewcontroller.FurnitureController home furniture},
{@linkplain ubik3d.viewcontroller.PlanController plan}...
<br>All the controllers of this package create their associated 
{@linkplain ubik3d.viewcontroller.View view} thanks to a 
{@linkplain ubik3d.viewcontroller.ViewFactory view factory}, and this abstract
factory is implemented in Sweet Home 3D with Swing components in 
{@link ubik3d.swing} package.
