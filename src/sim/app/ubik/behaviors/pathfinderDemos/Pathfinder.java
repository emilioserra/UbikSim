/**
 * This is a demo of how to use pathfinding on UbikSim based on the used of
 * Slick2D library and the BooleanPathfindingMap class.
 * 
 * A goal can be sead, and step makes the agent take a step.
 *
 * It uses a basic A*, the cell size (parameter of config.prop) is important to
 * adjust speed and algorithm efficiency (bigger cells make the algorithm faster
 * since nodes are reduced)
